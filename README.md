## Development Journey

This project was developed within a limited timeframe, which presented both challenges and valuable learning opportunities. Throughout the development process, I gained experience in full-stack development, database design, user authentication implementation, and creating an intuitive user interface.

## Application Flow

Users begin at the landing page, where they can choose to log in or sign up. After authentication, they are directed to the home page displaying all their boards. From here, users can create new boards, delete existing ones, or select a board to view. When a board is selected, users are navigated to a dedicated board page where they can view and edit the board's title, description, and image collection.
